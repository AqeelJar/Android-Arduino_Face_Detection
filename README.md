# Android Face Detection and Human Tracking Arduino Robot
Solution to project number 214 in the MATLAB and Simulink Challenge.

The solution uses an android device to detect and determine the position of a human face and then the android device sends the required response to the Arduino Uno robot to move the robot in the required direction to achieve a predefined distance between the robot and the human.

The solution uses simulink and matlab codes to detect and track the human face as well as controlling the Arduino Uno robot.

# Project details
A description of the implementation and the approached adopted.

1. Generate a face dectection algorithm in simulink that can be used on an android device (samsung).
2. Control the Arduino Uno robot using a Serial Connection between the android and Arduino.
3. Control the Arduino Uno robot using a TCP/IP Connection between 2 android devices (since the Arduino Uno robot doesn't have built-in wireless communication signals to android device)
4. Face Detection on android device used to control Arduino Uno robot (wired or wireless connection is decided here)
5. Additional Codes for the Arduino Uno robot (Standalone)

# How to run section
