## Demonstration Videos
This folder contains all the demo videos of the Simulink models in operation.
1. [Face Detection App](https://github.com/AqeelJar/Android-Arduino_Face_Detection_Robot/blob/main/Videos/FaceDetectionApp.mp4)
   - This video show how the face detection is used and shows the position of the detected face using the front camera.
   - This video also shows how slow the face detection responds when using a high quality pixel size of 640x480.
3. [Button Control with Direct Serial communication](https://github.com/AqeelJar/Android-Arduino_Face_Detection_Robot/blob/main/Videos/ButtonControlApp%20-%20Direct%20Serial.mp4)
   - This video shows how the user can communicate with the Arduino Uno robot with Android device using a direct serial communication line.
   - This video also shows how the robot needs to be close to the user when in operation. 
5. [Button Control with TCP/IP Communication between android devices](https://github.com/AqeelJar/Android-Arduino_Face_Detection_Robot/blob/main/Videos/ButtonControlApp%20-%20TCP-IP.mp4)
   - This video shows how the user can communicate with the Arduino Uno robot using a TCP/IP Communication line between 2 Android devices.
   - This video also shows how the robot doesn't need to be close to the user when in operation. 
7. [Arduino Uno Robot with Android Face Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/AqeelJar/Android-Arduino_Face_Detection_Robot/blob/main/Videos/FaceDetectionAndroid-ArduinoRobot.mp4)
   - This video shows how the face detection from the Android device is used to control the motion of the Arduino Uno robot.
   - Due to the robot being small, a picture of a human face is used for the face detection instead of an actual person's face.
