## Additional Codes used on the Arduino Uno Robot
This folder contains the [Obstacle Avoidance]() and [Line Tracking]() INO files used to test the condition and performance of the Arduino Uno robot before deploying the Simulink models.

### How to run section
1. Launch any one of the INO files in this folder on the Arduino IDE software.
2. Make sure the Arduino Uno robot is connected to the computer by confirming the port number under the tools tab.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno code by clicking the Upload button.
4. Make sure the battery pack is turned on.
5. Test the robot to see if it can either avoid obstacles or line track, depending on which code was uploaded.
6. Play with the Arduino Uno robot.
